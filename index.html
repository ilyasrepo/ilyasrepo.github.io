  <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>The identification of a car can be done in several ways: the VIN number which is visible under the windshield,
      the license plate number which is usually in the front and the back, or the style of the car such as the design
      of the emblem, headlights, tailights and other features. Nowadays, in US there are many traffic cameras, which
      help track down criminals when there's a need. However, if a criminal switched out the license plate to a fake one,
      and if a witness knows a make, model, and year of a criminal's car then a viable option is to consistently scan
      traffic camera footage and using machine learning with object detection we can narrow down the search options
      by identifying the location by searching for a car based on make, model, and year.
      <br>
      <br>
      We can apply machine learning and neural network techniques to train a model on an existing dataset to supply
      an image input and predict which car it is based on the mentioned attributes.

  <h1>Dataset for training and testing</h1>
    <p>We will be using a dataset prepared by Jonathan Krause at Stanford, which can be found
      <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html">here</a>. The dataset contains
    8,144 images for training and 8,041 for testing our model. Since the format of this dataset is not
    exactly what we will be looking for we'll have to augment couple items. First, the labels are stored
    in a Matlab format and they will have to be read into our Python framework that will be used. Second,
    the dataset reader will have to read the Matlab file and process the column that identifies if an image
    is to be used for training or testing, and split the images into these categories.
